### Broken-Wheel Idle
Broken-wheel is an idle game where your goal is to escape samsara, but the world demands that you wait in line for the privilege. 

This is open source. It's not meaningfully possible to keep javascript executables closed source, and this is easier for everyone involved. 

Created with create-react-app. Use `npm run start` to run a development server, and `npm run build` to compile a static site.
